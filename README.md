# Multimodal Brand Compliance Engine

Enterprise-grade multimodal LLMOps system for automated brand and regulatory compliance analysis of marketing videos using RAG, vector search, and Azure AI services.

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Multimodal Brand Compliance Engine** is an end-to-end AI system that automatically audits marketing videos for brand and regulatory violations.

It leverages multimodal AI, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and cloud-based LLM orchestration to generate structured compliance reports with severity levels and recommendations.

This project demonstrates real-world LLMOps architecture including:

- Multimodal processing
- Embedding-based retrieval
- Vector search
- LLM orchestration
- Observability
- Cloud deployment design

</p>

The system returns:

- Compliance status
- Violation categories
- Severity levels (CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR)
- Explanation and recommendations
- Confidence score

---

## 📡 Observability – Azure Application Insights

The system integrates Azure Application Insights to monitor:

- API request latency
- Dependency calls
- Error tracking
- Application Map
- Performance metrics
